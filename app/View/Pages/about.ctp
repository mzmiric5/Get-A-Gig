  <h1>About Get-A-Gig and how does it work?</h1>

<h4>Our Mission</h4>
<p>Our mission here at get-a-gig is to provide a facility that allows raw, up and coming musical talent to be able to find a venue to promote themselves at with ease. In doing so, we also provide venues with a service that allows them to find an acts in order to easily fill up events.</p>
<h4>And how does it work?</h4>
<p>It's really simple! If you are an artist/band you create a profile and provide the app with relevant information like genre and your location. The app then uses this information as filters and combines it with some of the Google Maps API in order to find venues looking for performers (note: these have to be in our database and have an event listed on our webapp). It works the same way for venue. You register, make a profile and create an event providing relevant information. The app then finds performers matching your filter and nables you to get in touch with them.</p>
<h4>Why we exist?</h4>
<p>Get-A-Gig is a webapp developed as a first year team project of the Y8 group at the University Of Manchester, School of CS</p>
